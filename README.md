## Gheorghe Barbuta

Senior full-stack web developer based in Moldova.

I build scalable, high-performance web platforms and business/SaaS applications, with a strong focus on reliability, maintainability, and real-world use.

Most of my professional work has been delivered through long-term client collaborations and private repositories. This GitHub profile exists as a public reference for my approach, structure, and problem-solving style.

I prefer clear, maintainable solutions over unnecessary complexity, and I take responsibility for what I deliver. When issues appear, I address them early, communicate clearly, and fix them properly.
