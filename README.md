### Overview

I am a senior full-stack web developer with strong experience building scalable, high-performance web platforms and business/SaaS applications.

Most of my professional work has been delivered through long-term client collaborations and private repositories. This GitHub profile serves as a public reference for my coding style, structure, and approach to problem-solving.

I focus on reliability, maintainability, and real-world performance rather than demos or experimental code.
